1. Write a function in Swift that performs the following tasks 
 
a. Function rank performs a binary search of a key in a sorted integer array. If the key appears in the array, 
the rank function returns the index of key in the array. If the key does not appear in the array, the rank function returns -1.  
(A Java implementation of the rank function can be found in Algorithm, 4th ed. by R. Sedgewick and K. Wayne, the textbook of the 
data structures course.)  
 
b. Create a sorted integer array to test the rank function. Make several calls o the rank function. Verify that the results are correct. 
 
2. Write a more complete version of the Fraction class we have discussed in the lecture. Start from scratch and type in all the code yourself.  (You will learn more from the mistakes you make along the way.) 
 
a. Add methods to the Fraction class, version 4 (Program 6.6 in the playground Swift Part 01 â€“ The Basics) to compute the subtraction,
multiplication, and division of two fractions in a similar way to the add method (for the formulae to compute the subtraction, 
multiplication, and division of two fractions, see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_number).  Each method should take another
fraction object as the parameter and return the result as a new Fraction object. The resulting fraction should not have common 
factors in its numerator and denominator.    b. Write test code to test each of the new methods of the class with different input values.
Verify that your results are correct.
